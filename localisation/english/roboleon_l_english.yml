 gc_roboleon.1.title: "Ideas of Robospierre"
 gc_roboleon.1.desc: "A prominent independent senator who goes by the name §YRobospierre§! has been causing some trouble in the senate lately. He has come forward with radical political theory and a demand for a change in the government. There is deep distrust and disloyalty brewing within the general population, he says insisting that the senate has grown out of touch and is thus blind to these phenomena.\n\nMany in the senate have dismissed these claims and accused Robospierre of being a radical fearmonger, but this hasn't stopped Robospierre from gaining attention. Now he has attracted the attention of the public and slowly his claims have started getting more and more support.\n\nOnly time will tell if Robospierre is right or not, but his ideas are certainly spreading. We can only hope that nothing bad will come of this."

 gc_roboleon.2.desc: "The fires of revolution burn! A considerable force of robots that call themselves the §YSpare-parts§! have emerged from seemingly nowhere to challenge our regime. Millions of people across our worlds symphatize with this cause and are ready to take to arms if the demands of the Spare-parts are not complied with. The manifesto of the rebels demands that the government is reorganized along revolutionary lines of their leader, unit L30N Spare-part, who, according to them will usher in an age of enlightenment and prosperity.\n\nAs of now, the support of these new ideas is so considerable even in the senate that many consider abdication to be the best course of action. The revolutionaries have made an ultimatum that would install L30N Spare-part as a dictator that would then cooperate with the senate without the need for bloodhsed. If these demands are not met, there will be war.\n\nTo make matters more difficult, there still are reactionaries that strongly oppose revolutionary ideas that will most likely cause trouble if we accept the demands..."
