 gc_senate_factions.3.desc:0 "Hello! This is a pop-up to configure a submod that enables modded factions from the Grand Campaign Senate for your nation. These factions are derived, but heavily modified from the vanilla ones and represent the political agendas of the player created senate parties. Below, there are three options to go with\":\" you can either choose to use the mod with §Yweighted ideolodies§! or without them, or disable the modded factions alltogether.\n\nWith §Yweighted ideologies§! feature on, your pops get their ethics changed so that it represents the senate composition. This means that the starting ethics of your pops will change. The pops will be heavily drawn to their ideologies for some time, but later be able to change between parties normally.\n\nIf you choose to enable the mod without weighted ideologies, the modded factions will still show up, but with less guarantee that every party will appear at all. \n\nThe third option is to not use the modded factions at all and play with vanilla factions.\n\nHave a good game!\n\n-AlexanderBoesen"
