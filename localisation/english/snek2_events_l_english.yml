 snek2.3.desc:0 "The sound of gunfire rang through the capital today. His Majesty, §YKing Cristo of the Dual Monarchy§! was shot at by an assassin while he was ascending the steps of the Senate building. Luckily His Majesty survived and the would-be killer was neutralized by the Royal Guard. However, the assassin\"'\"s last words have deeply disturbed many.\n\nBefore he was killed, the assassin shouted \"Down with the pretender! Restore the true Queen!\" This, of course, echoed the slogans of the former Snek-Purists, the so-called \"Worshippers of the Prophet\". Many Senators are convinced that this indicates that the cultists still hold considerable influence in our nation. Only time will tell if this is true. Senators are already demanding that the [Root.GetRulerTitle] declare a state of emergency to root out the extremists once and for all."
