 snek.1.name:0 "A Most Serpentine & Serene Anniversary"
 snek.1.desc:0 "It has been 1300 years since the refounding of the Church of the Victorious Snek and over a century since the great Schism and Exodus. Since then, the empire has enjoyed an era of peace and prosperity. As [Root.Leader.GetName] gazes at the stars from his balcony, only one thing occupies [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] mind, ambition. "
 snek.1.a:0 "To infinity and beyond!"

 snek.2.name:0 "Renovatio Imperii"
 snek.2.desc:0 "[Root.Leader.GetName] beamed as [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] continued [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] speech. After years of unorganized ineffective resistance against the Snek-Purist menace, finally the Galaxy will unite against its existential threat. \n\n \"In order to ensure security and continuing stability.. :\" \n\n The words rolled off of [Root.Leader.GetName]’s tongue as [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] had practiced this speech so many times before. This was it. This was the reward for so many empty Senate sessions. \n\n \"... the Galactic Community will be reorganized into the First Galactic Imperium!\" \n\n That line always sent chills down [Root.Leader.GetName]’s spine although [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] could never figure out why. \n\n \"To save and secure our society!\" \n\n [Root.Leader.GetName] nearly collapsed from exhaustion after that final line. [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] was only propped up by [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] aide and by the thunderous applause of Senators."
 snek.2.a:0 "I am the Galactic Community!"

 snek.3.name:0 "The Galactic Community"
 snek.3.desc:0 "With the formation of the Galactic Community, the empire stands poised to become one of the Great Powers of the Galaxy. Critics argue that peace was never an option and that this will only result in the weakening of our mighty nation. The official government position, however, is that this will bring peace in our time."

 snek.6.name:0 "The Petition of 1000"
 snek.6.desc:0 "A group of student protestors have gathered by the capitol building today to decry what they call ‘Censorship of History.’ The government, however, calls it /"Keeping the Public safe from insurrectionary messages./" /n/n These demonstrations, deemed ‘The Petition of 1000,’ have occurred every year on the anniversary of the Great Exodus. However this particular protest differs from all previous demonstrations.This time the students are joined by members of the Church of the Victorious Snek who ironically now march in support of their heretical and extremist brethren. Many officials are puzzled as to why they would be sympathetic to those who started the Great Schism. /n/n Meanwhile, a counter-protest movement has formed to challenge the aforementioned demonstration. Enforcers have been deployed to keep the peace but there is an uneasy feeling in the air."
 snek.6.a:0 "This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them!"

 snek.7.name:0 "Protests Successfully Defused"
 snek.7.desc:0 "Thankfully, no blood was shed today as cooler heads prevailed. The two groups slowly began to melt away in the face of superior government force. While many Senators are celebrating this victory over the protestors, others worry that this may not be the last. \n\nThe recent uptick in support for Snek extremism has worried many Senators whose memories are still engrained with images of the Great Schism and Exodus. Hopefully today’s events will help temper our citizens."
 snek.7.a:0 "Whew!"

 snek.8.name:0 "Protests turn Violent!"
 snek.8.desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the protest has turned violent. Lives have been lost and most importantly government property has been damaged. While our Enforcers managed to end the riot after a few days, it is clear that many lives have been lost on all sides. \n\n Despite order being officially restored, many fear that this incident is only the prelude to another Great Schism and civil war."
 snek.8.a:0 "This is not good"
