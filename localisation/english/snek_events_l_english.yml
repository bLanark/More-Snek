 snek.1.name:0 "A Most Serpentine & Serene Anniversary"
 snek.1.desc:0 "It has been 1300 years since the refounding of the Church of the Victorious Snek and over a century since the great Schism and Exodus. Since then, the empire has enjoyed an era of peace and prosperity. As [Root.Leader.GetName] gazes at the stars from [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] balcony, only one thing occupies [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] mind, ambition. "
 snek.1.a:0 "To infinity and beyond!"

 snek.2.name:0 "Renovatio Imperii"
 snek.2.desc:0 "[Root.Leader.GetName] beamed as [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] continued [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] speech. After years of unorganized ineffective resistance against the Snek-Purist menace, finally the Galaxy will unite against its existential threat. \n\n\"In order to ensure security and continuing stability.. :\" \n\nThe words rolled off of [Root.Leader.GetName]’s tongue as [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] had practiced this speech so many times before. This was it. This was the reward for so many empty Senate sessions. \n\n\"... the Galactic Community will be reorganized into the First Galactic Imperium!\" \n\nThat line always sent chills down [Root.Leader.GetName]’s spine although [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] could never figure out why. \n\n\"To save and secure our society!\" \n\n[Root.Leader.GetName] nearly collapsed from exhaustion after that final line. [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] was only propped up by [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] aide and by the thunderous applause of Senators."
 snek.2.a:0 "I am the Galactic Community!"

 snek.3.name:0 "The Galactic Community"
 snek.3.desc:0 "With the formation of the Galactic Community, the empire stands poised to become one of the Great Powers of the Galaxy. Critics argue that peace was never an option and that this will only result in the weakening of our mighty nation. The official government position, however, is that this will bring peace in our time."
 snek.3.a:0 "What could possibly go wrong?"

 snek.4.name:0 "The Phantom Menace"
 snek.4.desc:0 "[Root.Leader.GetName] sat down at [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] desk, exhausted after a long day of hard work. Incessant debate in the Senate can suck the life force out of even the most seasoned Senator. \n\nThe Speaker sighed. This job had aged [Root.Leader.GetHerHim] significantly. But despite all this, [Root.Leader.GetName] could not help but feel a sense of gratitude. [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] turned his attention to the Snekist cross mounted above the door. After all, it had only been a few decades since the Great Schism, since the Dark Times. \n\nThe Speaker could still remember the chaos and destruction of that era. How many lives were lost in that horrible war. But now [Root.Leader.GetName] felt confident that society had progressed beyond that. It was now a more civilised age. \n\nBut now was not the time to dwell on the past. For there was still much work to be done for the Speaker."
 snek.4.a:0 "At least the worst is behind us"

 snek.6.name:0 "The Petition of 1000"
 snek.6.desc:0 "A group of student protestors have gathered by the capitol building today to decry what they call ‘Censorship of History.’ The government, however, calls it /"Keeping the Public safe from insurrectionary messages./" \n\nThese demonstrations, deemed ‘The Petition of 1000,’ have occurred every year on the anniversary of the Great Exodus. However this particular protest differs from all previous demonstrations.This time the students are joined by members of the Church of the Victorious Snek who ironically now march in support of their heretical and extremist brethren. Many officials are puzzled as to why they would be sympathetic to those who started the Great Schism. \n\nMeanwhile, a counter-protest movement has formed to challenge the aforementioned demonstration. Enforcers have been deployed to keep the peace but there is an uneasy feeling in the air."
 snek.6.a:0 "This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them!"

 snek.7.name:0 "Protests Successfully Defused"
 snek.7.desc:0 "Thankfully, no blood was shed today as cooler heads prevailed. The two groups slowly began to melt away in the face of superior government force. While many Senators are celebrating this victory over the protestors, others worry that this may not be the last. \n\nThe recent uptick in support for Snek extremism has worried many Senators whose memories are still engrained with images of the Great Schism and Exodus. Hopefully today’s events will help temper our citizens."
 snek.7.a:0 "Whew!"

 snek.8.name:0 "Protests turn Violent!"
 snek.8.desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the protest has turned violent. Lives have been lost and most importantly government property has been damaged. While our Enforcers managed to end the riot after a few days, it is clear that many lives have been lost on all sides. \n\nDespite order being officially restored, many fear that this incident is only the prelude to another Great Schism and civil war."
 snek.8.a:0 "This is not good"

 snek.11.name:0 "Europa Universalis"
 snek.11.desc:0 "One of our probes on Europa has discovered an anomaly. A giant black monolith has seemingly appeared out of thin air near the last known location of the Snek-Purist exodus. \n\nSome of our scientists are clamoring for us to retrieve this monolith before someone else gets their hands on it."
 snek.11.a:0 "We must investigate this immediately!"

 snek.12.name:0 "Tick-Tock"
 snek.12.desc:0 "After months of studying the Monolith without success, it did something... unexpected, It turned on. Specifically, it displayed a holographic video complete with disturbing imagery and words. \n\nPictures of the Prophet and Lord Snek flashed violently across the projected screen. Then the audio recording began. \n\n\"Remain Calm. The Blessed Regency continues. The Galaxy shall be purified. The Prophet shall return. The Crusaders of Cygnus shall endure. There is much to be done.\"\n\nWhatever questions about the Monolith’s origins melted away in that instance. The scientists present were absolutely stunned. As the audio message repeated itself over and over again, some scientists laughed, some cried, most were silent. \n\nBut one feeling was felt by all.\n\nFear."
 snek.12.a:0 "What? How could this happen? They're supposed to be dead!"

 snek.13.name:0 "Snek-Purist Subversion"
 snek.13.desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, news of the Monolith and its message have spread across the empire. Mass panic and confusion has gripped the streets of our colonies as many formerly underground Snek-Purists reveal themselves. \n\nSome religious leaders are claiming that this is a sign from Lord Snek that the Prophet will return soon, just as the so-called \"Worshippers of the Prophet\" predicted. "
 snek.13.a:0 "Where will you be when the Prophet reveals herself?"

 snek.16.name:0 "A Gift"
 snek.16.desc:0 "As [Root.Leader.GetName] was finally able to sit down after a long day of work, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] heard a knock at the door. \"Come in.\" \n\n\"Your Excellency, a gift has arrived.\" said the familiar voice of [Root.Leader.GetName]’s aide. \n\n\"Bring it in.\" \n\nA robed man carrying a small package walked into the [Root.GetRulerTitle]’s office, stopping short of the [Root.GetRulerTitle]’s desk. \n\n\"Well what do you have for me?\" \n\n The man placed the small package on the [Root.Leader.GetName]’s desk not saying a word, he bowed and scurried from the room. [Root.Leader.GetName] carefully examined the box, being careful not to touch it. [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] noticed a small symbol imprinted on the lid. A symbol that looked suspiciously like the emblem of the Snek-Purists."
 snek.16.a:0 "Thank you for this gift!"
 snek.16.b:0 "Put it with the others"

 snek.17.name:0 "The Gift"
 snek.17.desc:0 "[Root.Leader.GetName] eagerly opens the box.\n\nThe package explodes."
 snek.17.a:0 "Darn"

 snek.18.name:0 "The Gift"
 snek.18.desc:0 "The box is placed in the storage room with hundreds of similar boxes. A few minutes later a rumbling could be heard from the room."
 snek.18.a:0 "Could have been worse"

 snek.22.name:0 "March of the Eagles"
 snek.22.desc:0 "Volunteers from around the empire are signing up to protect the nation! These so-called \"Eagles\" have boosted our enlistment sheets significantly."
 snek.22.a:0 "The Eagles march again."

 snek.25.name:0 "Our Benefactors"
 snek.25.desc:0 "It turns out those tin-foil wearing conspiracy theorists of yore were correct; there really were space reptilians who secretly controlled humanity. \n\nIn addition, these aliens have revealed that they are the original worshippers of Lord Snek and invite us to worship alongside them. While this revelation is a shock to many, only some have denounced our overlords. \n\nThese few decry what they call \"slavery\" and demand that we declare independence from these reptilians. However, most people are complacent with this arrangement. After all, why shouldn’t we trust those who are closest to Lord Snek?"
 snek.25.a:0 "A toast to our new Snekist friends!"

 snek.27.name:0 "A Brave New World"
 snek.27.desc:0 "We have done it. We have thrown off the shackles of our corrupt and decadent overlords and are now free to chart our own course through the Galaxy. \n\nNo longer will a reptilian shadow government secretly control our governments. The last Vestige of Ecdysis has been snuffed out and a new era dawns on humanity."
 snek.27.a:0 "Maybe the real Snek was the friends we made along the way?"
 
 snek.28.name:0 "Discord in the Streets"
 snek.28.desc:0 "Led by a coalition of merchants and otherwise free-spirited citizens known for their fierce opposition to authoritarian rule, a revolt has sprung up in [Root.GetName]! If they are not stopped, they will enforce randomly generated vengeance upon all within the governor’s palace."
 snek.28.a:0 "We must respond with moderation!"
 snek.28.b:0 "Okay, fine, no more \"emergency power"\ requests… for now"
 
 snek.30.name:0 "Mod Credits"
 snek.30.desc:0 "This mod was worked on by a number of participants in the 2021 PDXCon Grand Campaign. The members came together over a short period to allow their wacky dream to continue its beautiful existence. Without the following people, none of this would have been possible. \n\nThe Coders\":"\ Blanark, AlexanderBoesen, and Jerry_XLII \n\nThe Writers\":"\ Charles IV, Charlemagne, Neinguy1945, and all those from other parties who contributed their ideas \n\nThe Artists\":"\ Charles IV \n\nThe Quorum\":"\ Saint Paradoxus the Reluctant, Crendra Hiss of Snek, A Russian Camel, Wikkel High Priest of Snek, XiphosS, Snek’s Disciple Epicdude8428, Rangerscrolls, Tinny, Apophis, SilasPT, Charles IV, and Neinguy1945 \n\nAnd last but not least, a special thanks to\":"\ CountCristo, DJTruthsayer, Mr Freake, and Addaway, for their crucial contributions to making this glorious idea a reality."
 snek.30.a:0 "Somebody get these people a medal!"

 snek.70.name:0 "Hail the Nightmare"
 snek.70.desc:0 "The Crusaders of Cygnus have defeated another alien empire in its quest to “purify” the galaxy. Despite our best efforts, news of this has spread to the general population causing mass panic. Alien refugees are already starting their mass exodus."
 snek.70.a:0 "Remain Calm!"

 snek.31.name:0 "The War to End all Wars"
 snek.31.desc:0 "You ask, what is our policy? \n\nI will say, it is to wage war, by system, by starbase, and by planet, with all our might and with all the strength that Lord Snek can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalog of human crime. \n\nThat is our policy. \n\nYou ask, what is our aim? \n\nI can answer in one word - Victory. \nVictory at all costs \nVictory in spite of all terror \nVictory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival."
 snek.31.a:0 "This nightmare ends NOW"
 
 snek.32.name:0 "The Clock Strikes Midnight"
 snek.32.desc:0 "When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, \"Come.\" I looked, and behold, a pale horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death."
 snek.32.a:0 "And Hell followed with him."
